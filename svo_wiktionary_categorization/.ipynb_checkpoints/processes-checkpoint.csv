The voice is produced when the closed, taut vocal folds in the position of phonation are opened and made to vibrate by an air stream expelled from the lungs, causing sound waves to be produced. The volume of sound depends on the force of the air stream, and the pitch is determined by the frequency of vibration. The latter depends on the length (sex and age differences), tension and thickness of the vocal cords, as in the strings of a musical instrument. 2003, James Stark, Bel Canto: A History of Vocal Pedagogy, Toronto; Buffalo, N.Y.: University of Toronto Press, ISBN, page 26:Voice teachers who emphasize relaxation are loath to use such words as 'pinch' or 'squeeze' in relation to singing. Catford and Laver, whose field is primarily the phonetics of speech rather than singing, both considered 'full glottal phonation' to be the 'normal' setting for speech as well as for the falsetto voice [] . They advised against 'anterior phonation,' maintaining that it results in a somewhat 'tight,' 'hard,' 'sharp,' 'metallic,' or 'tense' speaking voice, and is probably associated with a high laryngeal position. 2005, Michael Ashby John Maidment, Introducing Phonetic Science, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, ISBN, page 97:Sound generation in the larynx is termed phonation, and phonation types (sometimes called voice qualities) are recognisably different kinds of vocal fold vibration. All languages use a phonation type called normal or modal voice as the basis for all speech. 2011, Sean A. Fulop, Speech Spectrum Analysis, Berlin; Heidelberg: Springer, ISBN, pages 56:When the vocal folds are adducted (closed) somewhat gently, then a certain amount of air pressure from the lungs below (subglottal pressure) can set the folds into a self-sustaining oscillation. This condition is called phonation or voicing; and it involves a delicate balance of tissue coupling forces and aerodynamic forces whose overall description is still a current research topic []",False,False,False,False,False,,False,,False,,False,,False,,False,False,True

The cleavage of the particles themselves and its attitude with reference to the plane of the greatest and mean dimensional axes help to determine the perfection of rock cleavage. The more nearly parallel to the greater dimensions of the particle, and the better the mineral cleavage, the better the rock cleavage produced. 1990, N[eville] J. Price; J[ohn] W.

Accordingly, Wilson defines rock cleavage (and schistosity) as a planar structure, usually distinct from stratification, which permits rocks to be fractured or cleaved into thin slices. Dennis (1977) defines cleavage as a set of closely spaced secondary, planar, parallel fabric elements that impart mechanical anisotropy to a rock without apparent loss of cohesion.

The main postulate is that there existed a previously unnoticed connection between this substitution, on the one hand, and the rise of a new syncretic Accusative case form, known as Genitive-Accusative, on the other. It is suggested that the missing link underlying both processes is the intolerance of the language to Subject-Object ambiguity.
