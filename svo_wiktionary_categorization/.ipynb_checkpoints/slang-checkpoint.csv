William FULLER III Brian K. Johnson, Defendants-Appellants. Nos.06-3678, 06-3768., number Nos.06-3678, 06-3768:To maximize his profit, Bew would chemically alter the cocaine either by cooking it into crack, or by rerocking it a process through which he diluted the cocaine with substances such as paint thinner. Bew sold the crack directly to users and the rerock cocaine to drug dealers.[] Fuller argues that no reasonable jury could infer that he shared a stake in a larger drug trafficking conspiracy because Bew regularly duped him by selling him rerocked cocaine. But the only evidence that this scam had any effect on Fuller's sales is the recording of one phone call in which Fuller complained about a drought caused by bad drugs. There is no evidence that Fuller had trouble profiting from the rerocked cocaine on a regular basis. And the fact that Bew dishonestly tried to maximize his own profits by secretly diluting the cocaine used in his transactions with Fuller does not diminish the evidence showing that Bew relied on Fuller to sell the rerocked cocaine. Accordingly, Fuller has not met his heavy burden of showing that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conspiracy conviction. 2017, Rerocc, in The Blue MM 3, performed by Peewee Longway:Beat the pyrex with the lock in the sockHit it with the water, make it rerock (Nigeria, fashion slang, transitive) Said about a garment, to rewear it with a different outfit, to rockit again. 2014 August 16, There is nothing wrong in rerocking your shoe, in Glowy Shoes[1]:First of all before i talk about rerocking of shoes, i'll give a brief definition using a lay man's english. rerocking means to repeat or rewearing a shoe more than one time with different outfits.
