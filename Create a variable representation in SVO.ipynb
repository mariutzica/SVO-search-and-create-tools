    "This notebook walks through the basics of how to create a variable representation within the Scientific Variables Ontology format. Please note that the steps presented here provide the initial steps for generating a variable representation and point to the **minimal requirements for describing a variable**. The variable representations should then be suitable to submit for revision to an SVO developer, who may subsequently ask for verifications to refine these concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to completely describe a scientific variable, it is necessary to specify both the _**Phenomenon**_, which is the physical object of the observation, and the _**Property**_, or characteristic of that phenomenon which one desires to describe. In addition, if the Phenomenon involves a _**Process**_ that is being quantified by the Property, then this should be specified as well.\n",
